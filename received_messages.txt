'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And
 all that you did was make me fucking sad
So don't waste the ti
me I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk 
about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an emp
ty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother o
r friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You 
ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made 
all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone000000000000
